***Plotly Homework***: This assignment used d3.js, Plotly, and JavaScript to create a dashboard with various plots to visualize a JSON dataset. The dataset was taken from a [study](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/results-and-data/) about the biodiversity of microbes found in bellybuttons. By choosing a test subject ID, the whole dashboard is updated to visualize the data for that test subject. Using Plotly, the dashboard includes a bar chart, a bubble chart, and an indicator chart. The dashboard is live at this [link](https://juliabrunett.github.io/plotly-challenge/).
