***Plotly Homework***: This assignment used d3.js, Plotly, and JavaScript to create a dashboard with various plots to visualize a JSON file. The dataset was taken from a [study](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/results-and-data/) about the biodiversity of microbes found in bellybuttons. By choosing a test subject ID, the whole dashboard is updated to visualize the data for that test subject. Using Plotly, the dashboard includes a bar chart, a bubble chart, and an indicator chart.

**data**:
- data.json (JSON file with the dataset from the study)

**static**:
- *js*: app.js (JavaScript file with the code to dynamically create and change each plot based on the selection)
- *css*: styles.css (CSS file to style the html page)

index.html: HTML file with code for the page
